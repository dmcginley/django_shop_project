## Site Layout

###### The general look and feel of the blog

<<< TODO images of the site >>>

## Accessibility

- Clean minimal design with the use of white space and small use of strong colors for text and links so it is clear to see where to go and what to do as some book sites can be over cluttered
- Contrasting colors e.g. a lighter buttons on the dark background with white text color on the Hero section of the home page
- alternative text on images, buttons, and < a > tags, where appropriate.
  The navagation bar and all elements on the pages are tab friendly, mostly through the use of Bulma.
