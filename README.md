## About the Project

An online e-commerce book Shop featuring some of the most well-known book.
In the store, you can go from searching for a book to reading a description about it to checking out in one flowing movement through.

It has a simple to understand clean design while being based on the standard for e-commerce book sites out there e.g. Amazon or Book Depository.

## Who is this website for

People searching for books who like a hassle-free experience while shopping.
People who would rely on searching books by title or author, not just by ISBN.

## Site Layout

###### The general look and feel of the blog

<<< TODO images of the site >>>

## Accessibility

- Clean minimal design with the use of white space and small use of strong colors for text and links so it is clear to see where to go and what to do as some book sites can be over cluttered
- Contrasting colors e.g. a lighter buttons on the dark background with white text color on the Hero section of the home page
- alternative text on images, buttons, and < a > tags, where appropriate.
  The navagation bar and all elements on the pages are tab friendly, mostly through the use of Bulma.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

All CSS passed with no errors, only a few warning because of vendor extension e.g.
