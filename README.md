## About the Project

An online e-commerce book Shop featuring some of the most well-known book.
In the store, you can go from searching for a book to reading a description about it to checking out in one flowing movement through.

It has a simple to understand clean design while being based on the standard for e-commerce book sites out there e.g. Amazon or Book Depository.

## Who is this website for

The site is for people searching for books who like a hassle-free experience while shopping.
People who would rely on searching books by title or author, not just by ISBN.

## E-commerce

As an e-commerce bookstore this is a b2c focused platform.

The website would relay on the sale of books primarily as shipping these products can be quite cheap.

With the ability for customers to login and edit and view their profile, or their order history, allows for customers to return to the site.
We also have a newsletter for people to sign up too. The newsletter section which is present on each page as a gentle reminder if they haven't signed up that they can do so at any time.
The idea with the newsletter is that we would offer discounts, early access two new titles and other promotions.

## Wireframe

Created in Figma

#### UX design

With the UX design I have gone for a muted color palette, so the books stand out and off white background so it is not too glaring on the eyes.
The general flow of a bookstore or e-commerce book website is fairly well known, so I have not strayed too far from these principles.
From viewing a book to added it to your cart, and from there you can checkout straight away.
The user experience is designed to be streamlined and without barriers or elements on the page to put you off your shopping experience.
I've gone for a classical modernist design to invoke the feeling that you would get usually in a bookshop or library, the use of whitespace is important for keeping the focus on the books while the site itself is just the shelves that the books sit on.

## Facebook Page

This is the second attempt of a page created as my first account was deleted by face book, so I added a screenshot here incase the link doesn't work

## Site Layout

###### The general look and feel of the shop

![navigation bar](readme_images/navbar.png)
Navbar - I included the banner also as it's part of the visual aesthetic

![navigation bar](readme_images/footer.png)
Footer - a simple clean footer with a Newsletter section above it

![navigation bar](readme_images/page.png)
Pagination

![navigation bar](readme_images/format.png)
The book detail page as would be see on 3 sizes of devices

## Accessibility

- Clean minimal design with the use of white space and small use of strong colors for text and links so it is clear to see where to go and what to do as some book sites can be over cluttered
- Contrasting colors e.g. a lighter buttons on the dark background with white text color on the Hero section of the home page
- alternative text on images, buttons, and < a > tags, where appropriate.
  The navigation bar and all elements on the pages are tab friendly, mostly through the use of Bulma.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

All CSS passed with no errors, only a few warning because of vendor extension e.g.

- **-webkit-border-radius is a vendor extension**
- **-moz-border-radius is a vendor extension**

![image of W3C CSS Validation](readme_images/web3_css.png)

- **lighthouse**

### Errors

All but a few lines in the python files passed the PEP8 online - (line length set at 79 ch) In settings.py the first NAME of the some in the settings.py I left longer, and in the webhook_handler I left longer so not to break the code as I still havening slight errors with it.

There is an error sometime when placing an order the order number that gets emailed out is incorrect.

## Error Handling

- Created 400, 403, 404 500 error pages

- Catching errors and returning messages of the error

- Catching errors in the search form for text, and number input (ISBN)

- Returning, redirecting the user to the home page or login page where required, if the user isn't allowed to that section of the site.

## Troubleshooting

**webhook_handler** error, couldn't locate the issue with:

- missing code in minor indentation errors in the strip_elements.js file, sorted by going over the code again, testing and running print() statements

```
    if order:
            print("order_number is", order.order_number)
        else:
            print("order not found")
```

- generated print() statements through the project to catch spelling errors, or code that wasn't being run or overlooked issues with the code e.g. Two different order numbers were being sent one for the success page and order history, and a different order number to the users email.

```
            print(
                f"CONFIRMATION EMAIL after FINDING order {order.order_number}")
```

working out what the order number was doing.

- missing "clientSecret"
- forgot fields in models

```

- Fixed an error in the clientSecret that was giving a 500 error on the stripe webpage when checking that the payment was working successfully.

var postData = {
        ...
        'client_secret': clientSecret,
        ...
    };
```

## Deployment

#### prerequisite for deployment

#### Deploying

**Step 1.**

```
$ pip install gunicorn
```

**Step 2.**

```
$ pip freeze
$ pip freeze > requirements
```

**Step 3.**
Create a Procfile in your root folder and save the following lines of codes in it
web: gunicorn 'name-of-application.wsgi'
Note: A Procfile has no file extension

**Step 4.**
Create runtime.txt

**Step 5.**
Adjust the settings.py file in the django app

- Look for the line that has

  ALLOWED_HOST = [ ]

  and change it to

  ALLOWED_HOST = ['*']

**Step 6.**
Push to Github

In railway website Click + New

- Select GitHub Repo, and then select which repo you wish to work from
- In Settings tab, under domain click generate domain
- A link to your deployed app is naw created.

For my app I make sure to set RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT=True to push all necessary files and folders to AWS.

From Visual Studio Code terminal

```
$ export RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT=True
$ python manage.py collectstatic
```
